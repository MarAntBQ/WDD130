  <h2>Marco Antonio Bustillos Quiroz</h2>
  <p>MarAntBQ</p>
  <p>I am currently persuing my Bachelor's Degree in Web Design and Development at BYU-Idaho. I expect to graduate Winter 2024 semester, I am taking this WDD130 Class because it's a requirement for graduating.</p>
  <p>I love to create programming and e-commerce videos for both YouTube &amp; Udemy, I love to watch movies with my family</p>
  <p>I am married, we have one daughter (2 years old), and we are expecting our second child at September</p>
  <p>I served my Full-Time Mission in Paraguay Asuncion North and Ecuador Guayaquil North Missions, and on Winter 2023 I finished a two years service mission as a BYU Pathway Missionary, I liked it that I had the opportunity to serve others to get in this wonderful program.</p>
  <p>I work as a Full Stack Web Developer in our Familiar Business called Marbust Technology Company, and as a Hosting Support Specialist at MBHostCloud a service from Marbust Technology Company</p>
  <p>I love BYU-Idaho because it helped me to get the knowledge to work in our familiar business, but it required to learn more from other sources and experiences, I would like that trending technologies should be taught here for example "PrestaShop"</p>
